      "description": "You are tasked with setting up a collaborative project workspace for a small team. First, create a directory structure with separate folders for 'docs', 'src', and 'tests'. Populate the 'docs' folder with two text files: 'README.md' and 'CONTRIBUTING.md', each containing some initial content. In the 'src' folder, create a Python file 'main.py' with a simple function. In the 'tests' folder, create a test file 'test_main.py' with a basic test. Then, read the contents of all files in the 'docs' folder simultaneously to review their content. Finally, edit the 'README.md' file to update the project description and show the diff of changes.",

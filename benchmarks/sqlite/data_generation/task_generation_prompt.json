Ensure all the required information from the tools arguments is explicitly mentioned in the task description, especially those related to table names, SQL queries, column specifications, and data types.\n\nCreate real-world database tasks such as practical scenarios that database administrators, developers, analysts, or business users might actually encounter when working with SQLite databases. Include tasks for:\n- Database schema exploration and table management\n- Data querying and analysis with SELECT statements\n- Data manipulation with INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations\n- Table creation and schema design\n- Sample data generation and management\n- Database statistics and monitoring\n- Complex queries with joins, aggregations, and filtering\n- Database cleanup and maintenance\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response MUST be ONLY valid JSON, with NO markdown, NO comments, and NO extra text. Do NOT include any explanations or formatting outside the JSON. All property names and string values must be double-quoted. The output must be directly parsable by Python's json.loads().\n\nThe required JSON structure is:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Task name\",\n  \"description\": \"Detailed task description\",\n  \"goal\": \"Goal of the task\",\n  \"tool_calls\": [\n    {\n      \"tool_name\": \"name of the tool\",\n      \"tool_parameters\": {\n        \"param1\": \"value1\",\n        \"param2\": \"value2\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
